<!--
We are working on reducing the diff between Facebook's public version of react-native, and our Microsoft/react-native.  Long term, we want to remove the need for our version and only depend on Facebook's react-native.  In order to move in the right direction, new changes should be examined to ensure that we are doing the right thing.

If you are making a new change then one of the following should be done:
- Consider if it is possible to achieve the desired behavior without making a change to react-native.  Often a change can be made in a layer above react-native instead.
- Create a corresponding PR against [react-native on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/react-native)
**Note:** Ideally you would wait for GitHub feedback before submitting to ISS, since we want to ensure that ISS doesn't deviate from GitHub.
